## END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

## Project Overview

This project aims to understand how various factors affect student performance in exams. The primary objective is to analyze how test scores are influenced by variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation courses. By leveraging data science techniques, we will uncover patterns and insights that can help in improving student outcomes.

## Problem Statement

The project's problem statement is to understand how a student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch, and Test Preparation Course.

## PROJECT STAGES

## Data Collection

-> Gather the dataset containing information on student demographics, parental background, and test scores.
-> Potential sources: Educational institutions, publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle).

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

-> Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
-> Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
-> Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships.

## Data Preprocessing

-> Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, ethnicity) into numerical formats suitable for analysis.
-> Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale.
-> Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Feature Engineering

-> Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
-> Analyze feature importance to identify which variables most significantly affect test scores.

## Model Selection and Training

-> Choose appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
-> Train the models using the training dataset.
-> Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation

-> Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
-> Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

## Insights and Interpretation

-> Interpret the model results to understand how each variable affects student performance.
-> Visualize key findings using charts and graphs to make the insights more accessible.

## Deployment

-> Deploy the final model as a web application or API for easy access and usage.
-> Create a user interface where educators or policymakers can input student data and get predictions on test scores.
